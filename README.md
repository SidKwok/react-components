> components with React

## Noted

 * They are some components I may use during my job or, you know, fun stuff. And more important is that I can code for something to kill my time.

 * All components are supposed to be separated, which means there is no global dependencies such like `bootstrap.css'`. But it may includes some third-party like `moment`. I will inform it in the docs if I use any third-party dependencies, please feel free to use them in your projects.

 * Eeach component is a file folder, which has `.jsx`, '.css' and 'readme.md'.

 * Remember that if you apply some global css such like `button {color: red;}`, the component may not perform in a correct way. In this time, feel free to change it in the component. It should be easy to understand its structure.

 * Each component may have a `readme` file, which is to explain how it works. It is actually more like a rule to force me to write docs after coding.

 * Should support IE9+.

 * Punch me in the face if you can't find any docs in any components.

## Guide


## Limits (to me)

 * Don't use css dependencies unless it is deadly necessary. Absolutely no global `css` like `bootstrap`.
 * Every component's style is `scoped`.
 * No preprocessor such like `sass` or `less`, only `css`.
 * Have animations' doubt? Find out in `Animate.css`!

Done talking, time to code.

By the way, React is gas, too!
